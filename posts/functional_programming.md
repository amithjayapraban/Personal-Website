Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the imperative programming style, which emphasizes changes in state.

JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, which means that it supports multiple programming paradigms. One of the paradigms that JavaScript supports is functional programming.

There are many benefits to using functional programming in JavaScript. Some of the benefits include:

More readable and maintainable code: Functional code is often easier to read and understand than imperative code. This is because functional code is more declarative, meaning that it describes what the code should do, rather than how it should do it.
Less error-prone code: Functional code is often less error-prone than imperative code. This is because functional code does not modify state, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
More efficient code: Functional code can often be more efficient than imperative code. This is because functional code does not need to track state, which can reduce the amount of computation that needs to be performed.
Here are some examples of functional programming in JavaScript:

Using functions to avoid side effects: A side effect is any change to the state of the program. Functional code should avoid side effects, as they can make the code more difficult to understand and reason about. For example, the following function does not have any side effects:
~~~js
function double(x) {
  return x * 2;
}
~~~
Using higher-order functions: A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument. Higher-order functions can be used to make code more reusable and concise. For example, the following function takes a function as an argument and calls it with the given value:

```js
function map(fn, arr) {
  return arr.map(fn);
}
```
```js
function(){}
```
